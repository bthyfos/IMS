            <h4 class="center">Reason to use IMS</h4>
            <p class="light">No external software is required to access the   inventory management system (IMS) as it can access from anywhere if you have laptop with internet connection. Depending upon the level of access you can login to the webpage to access the IMS. There might be multiple accounts to access the webpage. No need to install or upgrade the software. The data is secure in protected servers that feature firewalls and security programs. You can also access the inventory (IMS) system using PDA or cell phones. It is platform independent.</p>

            <h4 class="center">Bold, graphic, intentional</h4>
            <p class="light">Elements and components such as grids, typography, color, and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Emphasis on different actions and components create a visual guide for users.</p>

            <h4 class="center">Motion provides meaning</h4>
            <p class="light">Motion allows the user to draw a parallel between what they see on the screen and in real life. By providing both feedback and familiarity, this allows the user to fully immerse him or herself into unfamiliar technology. Motion contains consistency and continuity in addition to giving users additional subconscious information about objects and transformations.</p>
